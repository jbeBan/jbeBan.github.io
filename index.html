        <h2>Major Limerick</h2>
        <p>A view into my thought process before I switched majors from accounting to computer science:</p>
        <p class="italics p-limerick">I entered the room for my class<br>
            The concepts were easy to grasp<br>
            It was now I could see<br>
            I would hate this degree<br>
            In the subtopic of finance
        </p>
        <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>One of the things that I enjoy is music. I have continually been teaching myself to play the piano and guitar since around junior high. I also used to play the violin, which was probably the instrument I was best at playing. I have been to multiple concerts, including IGOR at The Great Saltair, and try to go whenever I get a chance.</p>
        <p>Another activity that I enjoy is soccer. I used to play club soccer for H.C. Storm and the Shooters. On one occasion, I played as a guest player for the Shooters in a tournament in St. George, which was one of the best times I ever. I have also seen F.C. Barcelona play live twice. Once in Washington, D.C. against Manchester United & another time at the Rose Bowl Stadium in Los Angeles, California.</p>
        <p>Most of all, I enjoy going out and having a good time. Whether it's boating, shooting, traveling, or something else, it's all fun with the right people. I'll never forget the time I went boating with a couple of friends and our boat died in the middle of the lake.</p>
